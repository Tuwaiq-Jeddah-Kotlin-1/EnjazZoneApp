## Application Idea:
The start, as the time of project submission, it's a to-do task or checklist in one application, emphasizing in its (practical & visual) design on encouraging the user to finish his tasks and achieve his goals,
Which was aimed and will be aiming to implement "self-development" rules, concepts and theories (i.e: S.M.A.R.T goals, Keep It Simple rule, 7/14-minutes pill of fighting procrastination, 30 minutes/5 minutes of effective work rule, display motivational quotes and messages... etc.),
as I am aiming to keep on developing this app for my personal use, ان شاءالله.
